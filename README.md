# Stocks-prediction
predicting stocks price using ANN (Deep learning)
The dataset used is IBM (International Business Machines) stocks has data from 2006-01-01 to 2018-01-01. There are 7 columns. The Date refers to the day of the price. The Open column gives the price at when the stock trading started at the beginning of the day when the market opened. The Close column gives the price of the stock trading at the end of the day when the market closed. The High column is the highest price of the stock at a given day. The Low column is the lowest price of the stock at a given day. Volume is the total amount of trading activity during a given day, and finally the name which shows IBM for all rows.
In this model we will predict the IBM high stock price. For pre-processing we first made the date into the index, after this the dataset was clean for the high column, only the Open and Low columns have missing values but since we only need High, we'll ignore it.
We will be using regression and we will evaluate the accuracy using plots and root mean squared error which is commonly used for evaluating regression tasks. The train data will be from 2006-2016 and the test data will be 2017 and after we have created the model, we will test it one more time by downloading the 2018 data for the IBM stocks and predict the high price using our final model.
